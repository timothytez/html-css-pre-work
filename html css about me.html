                <p>I am a motivated and ambitious individual who stop at nothing to reach his goals. My self confidence and stellous work ethics allowed me to succeed in sports, school, and life's challenges. One qoute that discribes my self and my purpose is "The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why."-Mark Twain.</p>

                <h1 style="font-style:italic;">More about me</h1>
                <p>I was born in Baltimore Maryland and grew up in a poverish neighborhood. Dispite my challenges, I graduated from grade school Valedictorian with multiple full rides to college in state and out of state. Along with my academic success I was amazingly talented in sports. I was also given scholarships to play sports. While attending Stevenson University, I got the opportunity to potentially get drafted playing baseball. After my injury I sought out for a new destiny in Criminal Justice. Upon graduating with honors, I held an internship in Madrid Spain with their Juvenile Justice Department. And for me, this is just the begining.</p>

                <h1 style="font-style:italic;">Why Software Engineering</h1>
                <p>As a Special Police officer for over 8 years, I worked day in and day out. I would spending days away from my family to try to provide a better lifestyle that what I had. I knew one day I would want a career where I can make enough and be home with my family. Through this thought process, I've showed intrest in cyber security in general. I knew one day I could push myself to go for it. However, that day was choosen for me. I was wrongfully terminated in May of 2023 for my special police work place. I started to spiral in the begining a realized soon after that I've been through worse. I've held a job since 13 years old and everything that i had in life i've worked hard for so this will not be any different. I gained the courage to apply to Coding Temple for software engineering and I plan to succeed by any means necessary.</p>
